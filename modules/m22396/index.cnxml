Most of the people who lived there were farmers who cultivated wheat, olives and grapes in the fertile valley. In time the villages that developed on the seven hills started trading and eventually united. By 753 B.C. Romulus, according to the legend, founded the city of Rome. The united Roman villages could offer each other protection against attacks, especially from the Etrurians. The people from the different villages also worshipped together. </para>
