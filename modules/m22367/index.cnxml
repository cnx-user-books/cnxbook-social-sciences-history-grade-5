      <para id="id5028457">Archaeologists have found the remains of many villages which were built during the same period. Broederstroom was inhabited between A.D. 350 - 600. The site was discovered after a thorough search of the area by archaeologists linked to the University of the Witwatersrand. They found the remains of round houses with clay floors, the largest being about 6 m in diameter. Clay pots of different shapes and sizes were also found. Iron ore found lying nearby indicated that forging was done on the site. The environment of the Broederstroom site is bushy. There is sufficient water in the area, and there are grasslands within reach.</para>
